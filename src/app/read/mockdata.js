        My love... I write this...
        I'm still not sure about how will I put these words together... 
        Coz these aren't just mere words that I speak...
        Nor the conversations forced to have in hesitance while wondering about your reciprocation.
        Not the words I chose to make a first impression that would potentially leave my footprints in your heart...

        NO...

        These are the words I choose today...
        These are the words that are supposed to convey what I really feel about you.
        These are the words whose kind you'll be hearing for the rest of your life now...

        Maybe..?

        Anyways,

        Do you remember that day? The day we met?
        No, Not the day where we saw each other, said a "hi" and walked away like strangers in opposite directions.

        No

        I'm talking about the day we actually MET

        When you laughed at my jokes, 
        Walked in my dreams,
        Ate from my plate and stole from my drink.

        Yes,

        I want to talk to you about that day when you brushed your fingers through my hair,
        Took a seat by my side,
        Heard me out so keen,
        That "I" went speechless.

        That was the day I spoke a lot.
        This time to myself...
        About you...

        What are we now?
        Friends?
        More than friends?
        Am I having a crush on you?
        Am I making the same mistake again?
        Am I....
        Falling in love?

        My love...
        I sat there quiet running the permutations and combinations in my head,
        Whilst you non-chalantly kept flowing with words.

        I sat there in solitude amongst all chaos of the world wondering about the blooming feelings in my heart

        I sat there losing myself in your eyes...

        Oh those eyes...

        They had a paradise hidden

        Each of em told a story about us,
        It showed me a world where we were born, met, fell in love and grew old together..
        I saw a river seeping through the mountains,
        I saw myself kissing you on our wedding day,
        I saw you right next to me cuddling in my arms,
        I saw our kids grow old.

        I saw the whole world standing there..
        No.. Not against us, but with us.
        I saw and I know that, that paradise was
        Built for you... Built for me...
        BUILT FOR US

        Know this love...
        For I shall always stand by you.
        Come the whole world that's with us turn against.
        Let the nature herself condemn us for the unnatural love that we share.
        Let it come. The worst of it my dear...

        I will stand and fight for my love...

        Will you stand by me close and near?....

        "So, what do you want from me? From this? From. Us!?" 
        Questions shot while I sat there on a knee, her fingers held, thoughts affixed in the depth of her eyes.
        
        I want nothing... But I ask of these...
        
        I want to walk with you in the gardens, while the morning sun lighten up your face
        I want to listen to that symphony with you in a single earphone
        I want to listen to your 'humm', say its better than the melody
        I want to be a part of your smile. Or better?
        I want to be a reason for it.
        
        I'd like to see your face, first thing when I wake up
        I'd like to hear you snore, call me crazy, but I do
        I'd like to un-mess your hair, blocking my sight from your pretty face
        I would like to kiss you awake, revealing you, to the chaos of the world
        
        I'd like to watch a movie, sit by you, hold your hand,
        Lend a shoulder, to hide yourself, from a horror scene or a thrilling sound
        I would like to laugh with you, for stupid thing, meaningless
        I'd like to wipe those tears, happy ones may what be
        
        I'd like to sit by you, ask your day, drive back home, talk all way,
        I'd like to hear it out, say that's fine, make you laugh, share your stress
        I'd like to kiss you bye, to the dreamlands known, meet you there,
        If like to hug you tight, make you safe, drift to sleep, by my side
        
        I'd like to stay by you, when you're sick, help you out, soon as could
        I'd like to feed you food, wipe your lips, wash your face clean your dress
        I'd like to lend my lap, tap you sleep, stay by you, all night long,
        I'd like to wake you up, to a cup of coffee, as you like
        
        All I ask are these small things, things of joy, that make me smile
        Gimme these, these I ask, come the end, I shall stand
        Tear drop rolled, she grasped my hand, held my head, said these words,
        
        "You dint say I LOVE YOU, But trust me my love, I understand"

        This poem was written by 2 people who broke up at almost the same time. 
        It's an amateur attempt to capture a nihilistic approach towards consoling  each other 


        Girl: I will  be with you forever 
        Boy: Blunder
        G: I'm the bank, you're the river 
        B: Blunder 
        G: You're my life, you're my world, you're my half, you're my whole, you are the only thing that shines in my life, you … 
            are my soul...
        B: Blunder
        
        G: He walked the path ablaze, "just a minute" she peevishly said...
        She yelled "Can't you wait ?" And there he was derailed..
        
        B: She emoted her pangs every time, 
        He yelled "Not required, not mine"
        The smoke was fiery and it reddened her eyes,
        Sadly for her even the romcoms weren't a prize
        
        G: The clock ticked 11 and soon it ticked 1
        His bones were crushed, his mind was numb,
        His spirit was asleep and to the pressure he succumbed
        "Baby.. Are you listening?" And he just hummed
        
        B: She was chained to him, obsessed and tied,
        He butchered her heart with a mortal hierarchical knife,
        And there she was abandoned while he lied..
        "Not again..." She sighed
        
        G: She lost her sanity, the reflection of her disparity
        Which he here, seemed to fear
        His love was suppressed, and his life perplexed
        And he... Chose to walk away
        
        B: Incomplete promises... Broken and shattered vows,
        He gave upon her leaving behind the Why, WHAT and HOWs
        She was replaced just like toy, there was a tornado and she was far away blown
        She stood in a corner sobbing and breaking apart for "his reasons" were still not known
        
        G: He let her go. Though his heart hurt and she mirrored her life in another frame
        The utterance was quite hesitant 
        For love really is …. AN ILLUSION
        And he chose to walk away
        
        B: Now the eyes are yours and heart's all pure
        And the treading now seems discerning for life is grand
        And more than just pangs, The strength in you... Is... Beautiful
        
        G: The tear drop might settle 
        B: But your charm must not
        G: For look at yourself once more
        B: The allurance
        G: The fire
        B: The passion
        G: The desire
        B&G: You're better than never before

        The mornings these days are lovely, the nightmares are nowhere seen,
        The cold breeze doesn’t bother no more, the blues are no more mean,
        Every dream you were a part of there was a smile that could heal, 
        But I don’t know why these dreams were there, I don’t know  what I feel 
        
        I feel I need you here… with me… for the coffee I sip, the chocolate I eat, 
        The series I watch, or the thoughts I think…
        But I don’t know why this need rose, I don’t know why I'm obsessed, 
        I don’t know how deep or far it goes, I don’t know what I feel
        
        I miss those rides, I miss those times, 
        Miss your innocent face and miss your cribs and whines
        I miss you so much, I feel like sprinting to you, hug you and say its gonna be OK
        But, I don’t know what I feel and I just let that thought decay
        
        Every time I cook,  I wish you could savor it, 
        Every time I wrote a song, I wish you could read it, 
        Every time you were sleepless, I wish I could be there with you and chit,
        Every time I wished you were here or I was there, I wish I could make it, 
        
        I don’t know why you're special, I don’t know what's the deal,
        I don’t know if its just superficial, I don’t know what I feel`

        ಮತ್ತೆ ಕನಸಿನ ಮೇಳ, ಮತ್ತೆ ಪ್ರೇಮದ ಜಾಲ,
        ಭುವಿಗೆ ಮುತ್ತನ್ನಿತ್ತ ಮೋಡ ಚೆಲುವ,
        ಉರಿಗಣ್ಣ ತಾಪದಲಿ, ಬಿಸಿ ಚಾಟಿ ಬರೆಗಳಲಿ,
        ಬರಿದಾದ ಭುವಿಗಿಂದು ಇತ್ತ ಹೂವ


        ಮುತ್ತನಿತ್ತನು ಚೆಲುವ, ನಾಚಿ ಸರಿದಳು ನಾರಿ,
        ಕೆಂಡಸಂಪಿಗೆಯೊಂದು ಅರಳುತಿಹುದು,
        ಅವನ ಸ್ಪರ್ಶಕೆ ಇವಳ ಬಿಸಿಯುಸಿರು ನಿಂತಿಹುದು
        ಅಚ್ಚ ಹಸಿರೆಲ್ಲೆಲ್ಲೂ ಹೊಳೆಯುತಿಹುದು


        ಮತ್ತೆ ಹುಚ್ಚರ ಕೂಟ, ಕೂಗಾಟ ಚೀರಾಟ,
        ಇವರ ಜೊತೆಯನು ಕಂಡು ಕರುಬೋ ಸಂತೆ,
        ಕುಲಹೀನ ಧರೆಯವಳು, ಕಸದಲ್ಲೇ ಹೊರಳುವಳು,
        ಆಗಸದ ವಂಶಕ್ಕೆ ಧಕ್ಕೆಯಂತೆ


        ಕಣ್ಣೀರ ಸುರಿಸಿದಳು, ಕೋಪದಲಿ ಚೀರಿದನು,
        ಗುಡುಗುಗಳ ಕೊರಳಲ್ಲಿ ಒಮ್ಮೆ ಧರಿಸಿ,
        ವೇಷ ಮರೆಸುತ ನಿಂದ, ಮನೆಯಿಂದ ಹೊರಬಂದ,
        ದುಃಖದಲಿ ಕೋಪವನು ತಂದು ಬೆರೆಸಿ


        ಹುಡುಕುತ್ತ ನಿಂದಿಹರು, ಅವನೆಲ್ಲೋ ಸಿಗುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ,
        ಅವನ ಹುಡುಕುವುದೆಲ್ಲರ ಒಂದೇ ಚಿಂತೆ,
        ಭುವಿ ನಕ್ಕು ನಾಚಿಹಳು, ವಧುವಾಗಿ ನಿಂತಿಹಳು,
